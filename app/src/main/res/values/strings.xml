        Welcome to the Pokémon Cards Matching Game,
        an Android application designed to provide a fun and engaging way to play a classic card matching game
        with Pokémons. This project is part of the embedded course assignment to implement
        telemetry data transmission using a freely available telemetry tool.<br/><br/>

        <b>Game Rules:</b><br/>
        1. The game consists of three rounds (8, 12, and 16 cards, respectively),
        each with an appropriate timer (30, 60, and 90 seconds, respectively).
        Match pairs of Pokémon cards by flipping them. Complete each round to progress to the next.<br/><br/>

        2. Multiplayer mode allows you to play against another player.
        There&#39;s one round with 22 cards, and two players can play on the same device.
        Each player gets one turn during which they can: Match 2 cards and get 1 point,
        or reveal two different cards and get 0 points. The player with the most points wins.
        The turns are distinguishable by the card frame&#39;s color: red or blue.<br/><br/>

        <b>Telemetry:</b><br/>
        This app collects and sends data about its own functioning and user behavior.
